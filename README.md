# Sudoku Solver using TypeScript Type System and Compiler

This repository is just a bit of fun that explores
pushing the advanced features of TypeScript's type system
to the limits by using it to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Note that we are not executing code or using data, we're only
defining types, but the types are compiled so that only
the solution to the Sudoku is a valid value.

It utilises advanced TypeScript features,

- Union Types
- Conditional Types
- Mapped Types
- Variadic Tuple Types
- Recursive Conditionals (4.1+)

The motivation was really the inclusion of Recursive Conditional
types in TypeScript 4.1.

## Setup

You will need to ensure you are using TypeScript 4.1 (currently RC)
so perform an `npm install` and set your IDE to use the workspace
version of TypeScript.

If you build, the code WILL give errors. This is just a bit of fun
and pushes the compiler further than you would in normal production
code so you will see lots of errors like,

- `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.`
- `Excessive stack depth comparing types ...`

I could make it a bit more complex and count the recursive loops
and bomb out after a certain number but haven't done it.

## Viewing the Solution

The easiest way to see the result is to open `tests.ts` in Visual
Studio Code and hold `Ctrl` while hovering over `Result1` and `Result2`.
